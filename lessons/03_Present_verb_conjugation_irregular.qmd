# Learning Objectives

In this lesson, the learner will:

* Conjugate regular verbs in the present tense

# Conjugating verbs in the Present tense

Conjugation is how a verb changes based upon the doer of the action. In English, this looks like:

> I jump
>
> She jumps

The first-person singular version of "to jump" is *jump*, while the third-person singular version is *jumps*. In English, conjugation is usually pretty straightforward in many tenses. So much so, that we forget that we do it. However, many languages, including German, have more complexity in their conjugation and different subjects have different conjugations. 

Let's demonstrate conjugation of a regular verb in German, *gehen*, which means "to go":

|||
|:---:|:---:|
| ich geh**e** | wir geh**en** |
| du geh**st** | ihr geh**t** |
| er geh**t**<br>sie geh**t**<br>es geh**t** | Sie\* geh**en**<br>sie geh**en** |

\* Note that the formal *Sie* follows the conjugation of the third-person, plural, even though it refers to the second-person singular or plural. This will be true in all tenses.

For regular verbs the rule is to remove the *-en* ending from the infinitive version of the verb and add these endings for a given subject:

|||
|:---:|:---:|
| **-e** | **-en** |
| **-st** | **-t** |
| **-t** | **-en** |
