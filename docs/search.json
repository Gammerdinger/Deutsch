    "text": "Approximate time: 30 minutes\n\nLearning Objectives\nIn this lesson, the learner will:\n\nConjugate regular verbs in the present tense\n\n\n\nConjugating verbs in the Present tense\nConjugation is how a verb changes based upon the doer of the action. In English, this looks like:\n\nI jump\nShe jumps\n\nThe first-person singular version of “to jump” is jump, while the third-person singular version is jumps. In English, conjugation is usually pretty straightforward in many tenses. So much so, that we forget that we do it. However, many languages, including German, have more complexity in their conjugation and different subjects have different conjugations.\nLet’s demonstrate conjugation of a regular verb in German, gehen, which means “to go”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nich gehe\nwir gehen\n\n\ndu gehst\nihr geht\n\n\ner gehtsie gehtes geht\nSie* gehensie gehen\n\n\n\n* Note that the formal Sie follows the conjugation of the third-person, plural, even though it refers to the second-person singular or plural. This will be true in all tenses.\nFor regular verbs the rule is to remove the -en ending from the infinitive version of the verb and add these endings for a given subject:\n\n\n\n-e\n-en\n\n\n-st\n-t\n\n\n-t\n-en\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nLet’s introduce a few more common regular verbs in the present tense.\n\n\n\nDeutsch\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nmachen\nto do or to make\n\n\nspielen\nto play\n\n\nlernen\nto learn\n\n\nfragen\nto ask\n\n\nsagen\nto say\n\n\nkaufen\nto buy\n\n\n\n\nCreate flashcards to learn these common verbs\nConjugate each of the verbs\n\nAnswer Key",

    "text": "Aren’t these just pronouns?\nWhile reading this you might be asking yourself, “Aren’t these just pronouns?” and “What does it mean to specifically be a nominative pronoun?” These are great questions and it is a distinction that we will be making early in these lessons. Let’s consider this sentence in English:\n\nHe eats her.\n\nHe and her are both pronouns in the above sentence, but He is the subject of the sentence while her is the thing that the verb is acting upon. We don’t say in English:\n\nHe eats she.\n\nAs you can see in English, our pronouns sometimes change based upon whether we are the doer of the action or the receiver of the action. This difference exists in German as well and is more nuanced. We will discuss this much more in later sections, but this is just to acknowledge that this difference exists so that we can demonstrate that not all pronouns are nominative, even in English.",

    "section": "What do we mean by formal and informal?",
    "text": "What do we mean by formal and informal?\nIn German, when you are addressing certain people, you will use the formal version of you and other times you will use the informal version. Times you would consider using the formal version of you would be:\n\nSpeaking to someone you’ve never meet before\nSpeaking to someone of authority (police, teachers, etc.)\nSpeaking to someone significantly older than you as a sign of respect\n\nThe general rule that I use is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to use the formal version of You\n\n\n\nIf a Southerner would use Sir or Ma’am to address this person, you’re probably using the formal version.\n\n\n\nMoving from formal to informal\nSome people, like police officers, you will always address with the formal version of You. However, like using Sir or Ma’am, someone may say something like “You don’t need to use Sir/Ma’am with me” and Germans have this same concept, but it is a bit more subtle. The person that commands respect will use the informal du to address you. At which point, you are now in a informal you relationship with this person for the rest of your life. The general rule for this is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to transition from formal to informal\n\n\n\nOnce they use the informal version to address you, then you are now on an informal basis with this person for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n\nDifferentiating between Sie and sie\nYou might notice from the above table that Sie (formal version of you (singular and plural)) is spelled the same as sie (third-person singular she and plural they). The pronunciation of these is the exact same and requires context to differentiate when speaking. The conjugation of the verb that follows can help with this context.\nIn written form the major distinction is that the the capitalized Sie refers to the formal version while the lowercase sie refers to either she or they. However, words at the start of a sentence are capitalized like in English and given that these are nominative pronouns, they are usually the subject of the sentence. As a result, it is common to see sie referring to she or they capitalized, but only because they start a sentence and not because they refer to the formal you.\n\n\nFormal usage moving forward\nWe will limit the use of the formal you for simplicity moving forward in these lessons, but I will note it were applicable. This decision is to try to streamline examples and because, from my experience, learners oftentimes get a fair bit of latitude on this distinction. German speakers are generally excited to see you trying to speak German and not as focused on these social nuances. That being said, if I ran into a problem and needed help from the police or was meeting my partner’s parents/grandparents for the first time, I would try to give extra special attention toward using the formal version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nMake flashcards for these nominative pronouns and practice them until you feel confident with them.",

In these materials, we are going to attempt to limit the vocabulary and rather focus on how the language itself works. At some points vocabulary will be necessary to progress, but I will be making attempts to minimize this as much as possible."
